# OOP-Object-Oriented-Programming-Python
<br>
This repository is a complete, structured guide to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, designed to help learners understand both theory and practical implementation of OOP concepts using clean, readable examples.

The goal of this repository is not just to teach syntax, but to build a strong object-oriented mindset, which is essential for writing scalable, maintainable, and real-world Python applications.

# 🔹 Core Concepts

-> Classes and Objects

-> Constructors (__init__)

-> Instance variables and class variables

-> Instance methods, class methods, and static methods

# 🔹 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

-> Encapsulation – Data hiding and controlled access

-> Abstraction – Exposing only what is necessary

-> Inheritance – Code reusability and hierarchy

-> Polymorphism – Same interface, different behavior

# 🔹 Advanced OOP Topics

-> Method overriding and method resolution order (MRO)

-> Multiple inheritance

-> Composition vs Inheritance

-> Magic methods (dunder methods)

-> Object lifecycle and memory management

# 🧠 Why Object-Oriented Programming?

<u> Object-Oriented Programming helps in: </u>

1. Writing clean and modular code

2. Improving code reusability

3. Reducing tight coupling

4. Making large projects easy to scale and maintain

# OOP is heavily used in:

1. Backend development (Django, Flask)

2. AI/ML pipelines

3. Game development

4. Large enterprise systems
<br>

# 🎯 Who This Repository Is For

1. Beginners learning Python and OOP from scratch

2. Computer Science / BCA / BSc students

3. Developers preparing for backend, software engineering, or AI roles

4. Anyone who wants to understand OOP beyond theory
